Merlin Dataloader
=================

The Merlin Dataloader library provides GPU-accelerated data loaders for TensorFlow and PyTorch.
With CPU-based libraries, data loading can cause long delays for developing models.
By using the Merlin dataloader, you can significantly reduce data loading times and speed your development.
