# dataloader Example Notebooks

The example notebooks in this folder will show you how you can use `merlin-dataloader` in your projects.

You can run them by installing `merlin-dataloader` locally. You can also run these notebooks using [docker containers provided by NVIDIA](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/containers).

The examples in this directory were run using the latest [`merlin-pytorch`](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/merlin/containers/merlin-pytorch) and [`merlin-tensorflow`](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/merlin/containers/merlin-tensorflow) containers.
